# Lobby

The **lobby** is an open source project dedicated to CMDS features for unauthenticated users. In other words, this project assists with implementing public-facing entry points to the CMDS platform. It includes components, services, and workflows designed for visitors who haven't yet signed in.

## Purpose

This repository provides shared infrastructure and code for managing features such as:

- Public home pages
- Public shareable assets like corporate logos for CMDS partners
- Public-facing announcements and notifications
- Sign-up and sign-in entry points
- Password reset workflows
- Access to legal content like terms and privacy policies
- Rate-limited APIs for anonymous interaction

Whether you're building a multi-tiered web application or a service-oriented backend, the **lobby** is intended to help you organize and maintain a clear boundary between guest-facing and authenticated user experiences.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cmds-hub/lobby.git
   cd lobby
   ```
   
2. Follow the setup instructions in the /docs folder for your specific framework or runtime environment.

3. Review the contribution guidelines if you'd like to get involved.
