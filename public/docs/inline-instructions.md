# about

Contextual help (or in-context help) refers to assistance that appears directly within the user interface - at the point where users need it. Alternative terms commonly used for this include:

- Embedded help - help content built into the interface itself
- Progressive disclosure - revealing information gradually as needed
- Microcopy - short, helpful text snippets within the UI
- Contextual guidance - assistance provided based on the user's current context

Specific types of contextual help include:

- Tooltips (hover or click-triggered explanations)
- Inline help text
- Field hints or placeholder text
- Progressive onboarding flows
- Contextual callouts or popovers

The term "contextual help" is widely recognized in UX design and technical writing communities as it emphasizes that the help is relevant to the user's immediate context and task, rather than requiring them to navigate away to a separate help section or documentation.

**About Reporting Lines at Keyera**

Relationship definitions:
- Leader (Workday): The individual to whom the User reports, as configured in Workday.
- Manager: The individual who oversees the user's site or department.
- Supervisor: The individual who oversees and directs the user's work.
- Validator: One or more individuals assigned to validate the user's competency profile(s); includes their site lead.

Additional notes:
- Reporting lines typically go up the hierarchy: Validator → Supervisor → Manager. However, there may be cases where a User’s Validator (i.e., site lead) overlaps with their Supervisor.
- The "Leader" relationship is automatically established and updated via the Workday integration and does not require administrative configuration. It may also overlap with one or more of the other relationships, depending on site reporting practices versus Workday org charts.
